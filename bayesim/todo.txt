copy todos from other places to here

count how many times deltas vs. errors were used (can use this in demo described below))

try starting from closer to posterior from pre-subdivision rather than totally uniformizing? (maybe average that posterior with a uniform)

check variables I've added and add to save_state (maybe use the m.__dict__ function?)

change project_2D to use grid also

make demonstration of how data sampling and error estimates matter, especially at high subdivision, and influence things in unintuitive but systematic ways especially with log vs linear spacing

figure out weird plotting thing with TE (something is transposed?)

add option for log comparison rather than just linear

save units for EC's (maybe build them into param_list?)

update commandline stuff

why does the diode example keep making "valleys" near the right answer?!?

make default value of th_pv dimension-number-dependent

test what happens with calc_gradients if a box is subdivided only in one direction

plotting points from an inference run?

sample through various EC's more systematically rather than totally randomly?
