TO DO LIST FOR BAYESIM
----------------------

[* for necessary for initial release, ~ for need to decide if it's necessary, - for future ideas]

* count how many times deltas vs. errors were used in calculated likelihoods (can use this in demo described below)

* make demonstration of how data sampling and error estimates matter, especially at high subdivision, and influence things in unintuitive but systematic ways especially with log vs linear spacing

* update save_state and load_state (maybe use the m.__dict__ function?)

* change project_2D to use grid also (also maybe pass patch parameters rather than actual patch objects?)

* figure out weird plotting issue with TE example (something is transposed?)

* need some more sanity checks and error messages in pmf.populate_dense_grid

* update commandline stuff

* why does the diode example keep making "valleys" near the right answer?!? (guessing to do with sampling)

* test what happens with calc_gradients if a box is subdivided only in one direction

* fully updated documentation

* more examples - TIDLS, maybe PC1D, maybe non-ideal diode, etc.

* allow model.__init__ to optionally take in model data

* make a save_state function for Pmf.py which model.save_state would just call


~ try starting from closer to posterior from pre-subdivision rather than totally uniformizing? (maybe average that posterior with a uniform)

~ plotting points from an inference run?

~ parallelization? May be tricky within a class because of pickleability issues, but there are workarounds e.g. http://qingkaikong.blogspot.com/2016/12/python-parallel-method-in-class.html.

~ figure out if list_model_pts_to_run can be made faster

~ for big data sets, save_state might need to write separate HDF5 files and store paths to them in the state file


- save units for EC's (maybe build them into param_list?)

- make default value of th_pv dimension-number-dependent

- sample through various EC's more systematically rather than totally randomly?

- making animation of PMF evolving during a run

- hierarchical indexing to save space rather than everything written out in every row

- option to give Python object (DataFrame) to attach_observations rather than only a file

- alternative error models (e.g. lognormal as well as normal)

- allow arbitrary parameter space sampling (e.g. user-provided points) in Pmf? Then regions could be defined by a Voronoi tessellation rather than hyper-rectangular-prisms or whatever
