Ideal diode solar cell
----------------------
The most self-contained example, in Jupyter notebook form. To run:

* Download the `Github repository <https://github.com/PV-Lab/bayesim>`_ and run from your local machine using `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`_

OR

* Run in the cloud using Binder! |binderbutton|

Kinematics
----------
Probably the simplest example, explained on the :doc:`bayesics` page. It exists in the `Github repo <https://github.com/PV-Lab/bayesim>`_ under ``examples/kinematics/kinematics.py`` and you can run it all in one go from a Terminal or step-by-step in an IDE like Spyder.

Tin Sulfide (SnS) solar cell
----------------------------
An example using an actual numerical model -- in this case, reproducing the fit (from `this paper <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S254243511730096X>`_) of four material and interface properties in a tin sulfide solar cell. Also in Jupyter notebook form:

* Download the `Github repository <https://github.com/PV-Lab/bayesim>`_ and run from your local machine using `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`_

OR

* Run in the cloud using Binder! |binderbutton2|
